## Initial Setup: Creating an Integration Chain in LeadChain

Within Zoho CRM, navigate to the LeadChain module. From there, you will initiate a new integration chain.

![Navigating to LeadChain and creating a new chain](https://github.com/otyeung/Zoho-CRM-LinkedIn-Integration/blob/main/Login/2-Create%20new%20chain.jpg?raw=true)

Now you have a choice of creating either a [Lead Sync Integration](#lead-sync-integration) or a [Conversions API Integration](#conversion-api-integration). This document will guide you through both processes.

## Lead Sync Integration

This section outlines the steps to synchronize leads from LinkedIn to Zoho CRM.

### Create Lead Sync Connector

First, you will need to create a Lead Sync connector within the LeadChain module. This connector will facilitate the flow of lead data from LinkedIn to Zoho CRM.

![Creating a Lead Sync connector in Zoho CRM](https://github.com/otyeung/Zoho-CRM-LinkedIn-Integration/blob/main/Lead%20Sync%20Connector/3-Create%20Lead%20Sync%20connector.jpg?raw=true)

### Configure Lead Sync Connector

After creating the connector, you need to configure its settings.

#### Configure Source and Destination

Connect your LinkedIn account to Zoho CRM and select your LinkedIn Lead Gen Form.

*Please note: Each connector (lead chain) supports only one LinkedIn Lead Gen Form. If you need to synchronize multiple forms, you must create a separate connector (lead chain) for each form.*

#### Configure Field Mapping

Next, you will map the fields from your LinkedIn Lead Gen Form to the corresponding fields in Zoho CRM. This ensures that lead information is accurately transferred.

#### Field Mapping Best Practices

For optimal data synchronization, we recommend mapping the following fields.

**Person Info Fields:**
It is advisable to map these core personal information fields:
| Zoho Field   | LinkedIn Field                                              |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Last Name    | Last name                                                   |
| Company      | Company name                                                |
| First Name   | First name                                                  |
| Title        | Job Role                                                    |
| Email        | Business Email (use Email if Business Email is unavailable) |
| Country      | Country/Region                                              |

**Metadata Fields:**
Mapping these metadata fields will enhance tracking and reporting capabilities:
| Zoho Field       | LinkedIn Field          |
|------------------|-------------------------|
| Lead Source      | LinkedIn (static label) |
| Social Lead ID   | Lead Id                 |
| Ad Campaign Name | Campaign Name           |
| Ad               | Adset Name              |

**Congratulations! You have successfully set up the LinkedIn Lead Sync integration with Zoho CRM.**

## Conversion API Integration

This section explains how to set up the Conversions API integration to send conversion events from Zoho CRM to LinkedIn.

### Create Conversion in LinkedIn Campaign Manager

The first step is to create a conversion rule within your LinkedIn Campaign Manager.
Navigate to **Measurement** -> **Conversion Tracking** -> **Create Conversion** -> **Conversion API**.

![Creating a CAPI Conversion in LinkedIn Campaign Manager](https://github.com/otyeung/Zoho-CRM-LinkedIn-Integration/blob/main/Conversions%20API%20Connector/4-LinkedIn%20Create%20CAPI%20Conversion.jpg?raw=true)

Next, define your CAPI configuration. This involves:
*   Giving a descriptive name to your conversion rule (e.g., including source, partner name, table name, or filter criteria).
*   Specifying the conversion category.
*   Setting the attribution window length and type.

![Defining the CAPI Conversion Configuration in LinkedIn](https://github.com/otyeung/Zoho-CRM-LinkedIn-Integration/blob/main/Conversions%20API%20Connector/5-LinkedIn%20Define%20CAPI%20configuration.jpg?raw=true)

Select **"Direct API"** as the data source and click **"Next Step"** to proceed.

![Selecting "Direct API" as the Data Source in LinkedIn](https://github.com/otyeung/Zoho-CRM-LinkedIn-Integration/blob/main/Conversions%20API%20Connector/6-LinkedIn%20Select%20Data%20Source.jpg?raw=true)

Ensure that you have associated the appropriate campaign(s) with your conversion rule (the campaign count must be greater than zero).

### Configure Conversions API Connector Source and Destination

In the connector configuration, specify the Zoho CRM object (e.g., Leads, Contacts) from which you want to synchronize conversion events. Also, select the CAPI conversion name that you previously created in LinkedIn Campaign Manager.

![Configuring Source and Destination for Zoho CAPI Connector](https://github.com/otyeung/Zoho-CRM-LinkedIn-Integration/blob/main/Conversions%20API%20Connector/9-Zoho%20Connect%20Source%20and%20Destination.jpg?raw=true)

### Configure Conversions API Field Mapping

Map the fields from Zoho CRM to the corresponding fields in the LinkedIn Conversion API.

**Mandatory Fields:**
These fields are essential for the integration to function correctly:
| Fields in LinkedIn Conversion API | Fields in Zoho CRM |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------|
| Event Time                        | Created Time       |
| Email                             | Email              |
| First Name                        | First Name         |
| Last Name                         | Last Name          |

**Recommended Fields:**
Mapping these fields can help improve the match rate and data accuracy:
| Fields in LinkedIn Conversion API | Fields in Zoho CRM |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------|
| Title                             | Title              |
| Company Name                      | Company            |
| Social Lead ID                    | Social Lead ID     |

*Optionally, you can add filters to segment the data being sent, for example, based on `EventTime` (e.g., within the last 90 days) or specific market segments.*

![Zoho CAPI Field Mapping Configuration - Part 1](https://github.com/otyeung/Zoho-CRM-LinkedIn-Integration/blob/main/Conversions%20API%20Connector/10-Zoho%20Field%20Mapping%201.jpg?raw=true)

![Zoho CAPI Field Mapping Configuration - Part 2](https://github.com/otyeung/Zoho-CRM-LinkedIn-Integration/blob/main/Conversions%20API%20Connector/11-Zoho%20Field%20Mapping%202.jpg?raw=true)

Once you have configured the field mapping and any optional filters, click **"Save and Publish"**.

You should now see the CAPI chain (e.g., for the **"Lead"** object) created and ready to send conversion events from Zoho CRM.

### Send Test Conversion

To validate the setup, you need to send a test conversion from Zoho CRM.

Create a new lead (or the object you selected during configuration) in the respective Zoho CRM module (e.g., **Leads**).

![Creating a Test Lead in Zoho CRM for CAPI Verification](https://github.com/otyeung/Zoho-CRM-LinkedIn-Integration/blob/main/Conversions%20API%20Connector/13-Zoho%20create%20CAPI%20event.jpg?raw=true)

Fill in the necessary information for the test record and click **"Save"**.

![Filling in Lead Information for the Test Conversion in Zoho CRM](https://github.com/otyeung/Zoho-CRM-LinkedIn-Integration/blob/main/Conversions%20API%20Connector/14-Zoho%20create%20new%20lead.jpg?raw=true)

Navigate to the CAPI chain you created (e.g., **"Lead"**) within the LeadChain module in Zoho CRM. You should see the CAPI event scheduled for sending.

*Note: Conversion events are synchronized to LinkedIn approximately every 3 hours.*

![CAPI Event Scheduled in Zoho LeadChain Dashboard](https://github.com/otyeung/Zoho-CRM-LinkedIn-Integration/blob/main/Conversions%20API%20Connector/15-Zoho%20CAPI%20event%20scheduled.jpg?raw=true)

After the 3-hour synchronization interval, verify that the event has been sent by checking the Lead Chain dashboard.

Finally, go back to your LinkedIn Campaign Manager. The status of your CAPI conversion rule should now be **"Active"**, indicating that LinkedIn has successfully received the test conversion data.

![CAPI Conversion Status showing "Active" in LinkedIn Campaign Manager](https://github.com/otyeung/Zoho-CRM-LinkedIn-Integration/blob/main/Conversions%20API%20Connector/17-LinkedIn%20CAPI%20Conversion%20Active.jpg?raw=true)

**Congratulations! You have successfully set up the LinkedIn Conversions API integration with Zoho CRM.**
